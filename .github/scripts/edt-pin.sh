# edt-pin.sh — pin guard for the 1C:EDT base the CI e2e / conformance gate validates against.
#
# WHY. The public 1C:EDT p2 channel  https://edt.1c.ru/downloads/releases/ruby/<channel>/
# is a SIMPLE p2 repository that is MUTATED IN PLACE on every point-release — there is NO
# immutable per-release URL to pin to, and the PREVIOUS service release's jars are DELETED.
# So the EDT-base GitHub cache, keyed only by the channel URL, silently goes stale: an OLD
# cached base gets overlaid with the NEWLY-served EDT bundles, and the p2 director then cannot
# pick a consistent servlet-api / jetty wiring for dt.html -> activedocument.ui (a felix
# uses-constraint conflict) — the systemic, intermittent e2e / conformance failure.
#
# WHAT. We PIN the EDT build qualifier each channel is expected to serve, DETECT what the
# channel actually serves right now (the com._1c.g5.v8.dt.core version inside content.xml.xz),
# and FAIL LOUDLY when 1C ships a newer build — forcing a conscious re-pin. The detected
# qualifier is echoed on stdout for the cache key, so the base cache tracks the served build
# and can never be stale (a new build => a new key => a fresh, self-consistent base).
#
# WHAT ELSE (added after the 2026-09-18 outage). A p2 repository has TWO indexes that must
# agree: content.xml.xz says which units EXIST, artifacts.xml.xz says which jars are STORED.
# Resolution reads the first and downloads per the second, so when they disagree EVERY EDT
# bundle 404s and Tycho reports it as `bundleLocation can't be null for artifact …` — a message
# that names neither the repository nor the 404. That outage cost ~40 minutes to diagnose and
# was invisible to this guard, which compared the PIN against ONE index and passed green while
# the channel was unbuildable. We now read both and refuse on a disagreement, with the reason
# spelled out. The disagreement need not originate at 1C: a CDN edge serving one index from a
# stale cache while the other is fresh produces exactly the same unbuildable view, and that view
# is what the client actually gets — which is precisely why the check belongs on the client.
#
# USAGE.  edt-pin.sh <channel> <edt-p2-url>
#   <channel>     the ruby/<channel>/ segment, e.g. 2025.2
#   <edt-p2-url>  the full p2 URL (trailing slash), e.g. https://.../ruby/2025.2/
# Prints ONE line on stdout: the build qualifier to fold into the cache key. All human /
# annotation output goes to stderr. Exit 1 on a confirmed drift, an inconsistent channel, or an
# unknown channel.
#
# TO RE-PIN after 1C ships a new build: bump the qualifier in the PIN MAP below to the value
# the failure message reports, then re-run — the base cache refreshes automatically. Re-pinning
# is a ONE-WAY door: the previous service release is deleted from the channel, so from then on
# it can only be validated against a LOCAL installation (source/verify-oldest-platform.sh).
