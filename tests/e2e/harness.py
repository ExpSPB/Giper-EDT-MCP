#
# Sized at the full CLEAN_ATTEMPTS cycles so that in the ORDINARY failure - revalidate_objects
# simply being refused, settle after settle succeeding - every configured attempt starts with room to
# spare and the budget is never what ends the cycle. It is NOT a promise that the counters always
# win: interleave a settle failure before each refused refresh and the time runs out first (with the

# _clean_failure_cause names the budget when the budget is what stopped it.
#
# A budget, NOT a hard stop. Neither a settle nor a clean_project can be cancelled once started and

# the split and CLEAN_ATTEMPTS+SETTLE_ATTEMPTS without a budget at all. The pathological case was

# tests, ~3560 s, ~11 s each, while the tool call itself is a fraction of a second. Most of
# those tests are NEGATIVE - they hand a write tool a bad argument and assert the refusal -
# and refusing changes nothing, so the clean_project they pay for re-imports a model that
# never moved.
#
# The shortcut is decided on EVIDENCE, never on a guess about what a tool "probably" did:
# after the test the fixture must be git-clean AND the model's top-object inventory must
# equal the snapshot taken before the suite ran. Failing either, the full reset runs. On top
# of that, a test that invoked one of the DEEP tools always pays in full - those mutate
# broadly enough (cascades, cross-object rewrites, whole-configuration import) that an
# unchanged inventory is not evidence of an unchanged model.

# top-object inventory identical. Both probes then report "pristine" while the next test
# inherits an in-memory child. A refusal changes nothing, so negative tests — the ones the
# shortcut is actually for — still qualify.

    Metadata-write tools (create/add/delete/rename metadata) mutate the in-memory BM model
    but do NOT flush every change to disk, so a git reset alone cannot undo them — the model
    would carry the unsaved change into the next test. revalidate_objects refreshes the model
    from the clean disk without stopping the project, avoiding EDT 2025.2's stop-time save of
    the stale in-memory change. The orchestrator calls this after each
    kind='write-metadata' test.

    CRITICAL ORDERING (root cause of the rename >300s e2e timeout): a metadata write also
    SCHEDULES a derived-data recompute, so the project is BUILDING right after the test —
    and revalidate_objects REFUSES a building project. The old code called the refresh FIRST
    and swallowed the refusal (it returns an isError result, not an exception), leaving the
    model UN-reset; the next rename then blocked for minutes inside EDT's still-draining
    derived-data pipeline (DerivedDataManager.blockAsyncPipeline), tripping the per-test
    timeout. So: wait for the project to SETTLE first (out-waiting that recompute) so the
    refresh is accepted, THEN revalidate_objects. Retry if a late-starting recompute re-flags
    BUILDING between the wait and the call.

    A successful revalidation is NOT that guarantee on its own, which is the second race
    this function has to close. The orchestrator reverts the fixture on disk BEFORE the
    test's model cleanup, but a metadata write's disk export is ASYNC: EDT can flush the
    MUTATED state back out DURING the settle wait, i.e. AFTER that revert — and then
    revalidate_objects faithfully refreshes the mutated disk and still reports ok. Hence,
    per attempt: settle FIRST so any lagging export has landed, wait for a quiet fixture,
    re-revert the disk, THEN refresh, and finally VERIFY the baseline is actually back
    (_baseline_mismatch) instead of assuming it. Verification — not a longer timeout — is
    what makes this correct: the failure is a lost write-back race, not slowness.

    The COUNT sibling of poll_disk_contains, for the "written exactly once" class of assertion (an

    the claim, so the failure message has to carry the count - a bare
    `read_disk(f).count(x) == n` reports neither the number it saw nor the file, and "must NOT
    duplicate" then describes a count of 0 just as readily as a count of 2.

    WHY THE DWELL, and not "return on the first matching read": in the case this exists for, the
    expected count is ALREADY true before the call under test - the row was written by the previous
    step. A first-sample poll is therefore satisfied by the PRE-call contents and never observes
    what the call did, so a regression that eventually writes a second row would pass. Requiring the
    count to HOLD for `stable_for` closes that: a late duplicate resets the dwell, the count settles
    at 2, `expected` is never reached again and the call fails with the count it actually saw.

    This is a dwell, not a proof that an export happened - the write under test may legitimately be
    a no-op that rewrites nothing, so demanding evidence of a rewrite would fail those cases
    spuriously. Pick `stable_for` longer than the export lag you care about.
