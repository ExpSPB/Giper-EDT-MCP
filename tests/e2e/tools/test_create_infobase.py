e2e tests for create_infobase (kind: action).

WHAT THE TOOL DOES
------------------
create_infobase creates a new FILE 1C infobase (database) on disk and binds it to an
EDT configuration project, so it surfaces via get_applications as an application of
type com.e1c.g5.dt.applications.type.infobase. The creation shells out to
IInfobaseCreationOperation.perform(...), which invokes the 1cv8 thick-client binary
(1cv8 CREATEINFOBASE). This requires a registered 1C:Enterprise platform runtime in
EDT; without one, the tool returns an actionable error.

RESPONSE SHAPE
--------------
JSON tool (getResponseType() == JSON); payload in r.structured:
  success path: {"success": true, "action": "created", "project", "infobaseFile",
                 "infobaseName", ["applications": [...]], ["applicationId": "..."],
                 ["boundToProject": true], ["verification": "verified" |
                 "mismatched" | "not_verifiable"], ["verificationReason"], "message"}
  error path:   {"success": false, "error": "..."} - and, for the not-bound refusal below,
                the same action/infobaseFile/infobaseName/applications payload plus
                "boundToProject": false

  boundToProject (issue #412) reports what the post-association read-back ESTABLISHED,
  and the tool never claims the binding on its own: true = the application was found;
  false = the poll budget was spent and the LAST read compared every application without
  finding it, which is reported as an ERROR that
  still carries action/infobaseFile/infobaseName/applications (the database exists, so
  the refusal must not read as "nothing happened"); ABSENT = the comparison could not be
  completed (the read failed, the call was interrupted before the poll budget was spent,
  or an application's identity was unreadable), so the call stays successful and the
  message says UNVERIFIED. The applications echo itself is omitted when no read produced
  a snapshot at all.

  verification is present when a requested credential write reaches read-back.
  verificationReason explains mismatched and not_verifiable outcomes and is absent for
  verified. not_verifiable means EDT accepted the write but could not prove a persisted
  entry; the message must not claim that credentials were stored.

CI / HEADLESS STRATEGY (IMPORTANT)
-----------------------------------
The happy-path create round-trip requires a 1C platform runtime that headless CI
lacks. The primary tests (the ones CI exercises) are the NEGATIVE matrix — they
exercise the full validation chain without needing a platform and prove the tool is
wired correctly:
  - missing required projectName  -> "projectName is required"
  - missing required infobaseFile -> "infobaseFile is required"
  - non-existent project          -> "Project not found: <name>"
  - no-platform-runtime probe     -> the actionable platform-not-registered error
    (this is the path CI actually exercises for create_infobase — it proves that
    the platform probe fires fast and cleanly instead of hanging)
    Set EDT_MCP_INSTALLED_PLATFORM=1 when EDT has a registered platform; this
    negative case is skipped because its no-runtime precondition does not hold.

The live happy-path (create -> verify via get_applications -> delete round-trip) is
Tier-2 / stand-only, gated behind EDT_MCP_LIVE_INFOBASE=1 (the same gate as
test_live_roundtrip.py). It is documented here but SKIPPED in headless CI.

NOTE: create_infobase never writes TestConfiguration source files (it targets the
infobase, which lives in the EDT workspace, not in git). Every call in this file
leaves the project tree clean: assert_no_diff() on all paths.
