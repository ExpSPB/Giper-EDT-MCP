"""
VENDOR-SUPPORT guard coverage - issue #642.

EDT enforces vendor support only in its UI (read-only editors, hidden actions) and in its
refactorings (as bypassable problems); a BM write below that succeeds silently. The writing tools
therefore ask EDT's own editing-support check (IModelEditingSupport) before they write, and refuse
a change to an object whose support rule does not allow it. These tests prove that guard against
EDT's REAL verdict on a real support file, which no unit test can: the verdict is the platform's.

Fixture ground truth (tests/SupportedConfiguration, src/Configuration/Configuration.distr in
per-object mode - the rules allow changes, and each item without userMode is locked):
  locked:   the Configuration itself (so no new top-level object, and no top object deletable),
            Catalog.Locked (+ its attribute Weight), Catalog.<Russian "Closed"> (+ its attribute
            Code2), CommonModule.Locked, Report.LockedReport (no DCS yet), Role.LockedRole;
  editable: Catalog.Open (+ its attribute Note), CommonModule.Open, Role.OpenRole, the language.
  Role.LockedRole holds an attribute right on Catalog.Open.Attribute.Note, so deleting that
  (editable) attribute has to change a locked role - the delete's support-derived prohibition.
  A new unreferenced attribute of editable Catalog.Open is deletable on EDT 2025.2.5;
  deleting Catalog.Open itself still changes the locked configuration and is refused.
  Cascading deletions remain blocked when EDT reports a locked referencing object.

Anti-cheat: every refusal is checked for its wording AND for the fixture being byte-identical
afterwards (a content hash of every file, not only git status), and the editable controls must
succeed and reach disk - a guard that refused everything would fail those, one that refused
nothing would fail the rest.
