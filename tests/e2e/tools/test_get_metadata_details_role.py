"""
e2e tests for get_metadata_details' ROLE branch - the access-rights matrix READ side (#454).

A Role FQN does not render the generic property block: GetMetadataDetailsTool.processFqn routes it
to RoleRightsReader, which renders one document - `# Role Rights: <fqn>`, then `## Properties`
(the three role booleans), `## Rights matrix` (Object | Right | Value), `## Row-level security
(RLS)` and `## RLS templates` - followed by the shared `**Origin:**` footer. A role whose
`Role.getRights()` is not a concrete RoleDescription renders the single note
`_(this role has no editable rights model)_` instead, and nothing else.

This file covers the six things only the wire can prove about that reader:

  * the empty state - create_metadata persists a concrete, empty rights model in the creating
    transaction, so the reader must render its false flags and empty sections;
  * the VALUE labels - `allowed` (RightValue.SET) and `denied` (RightValue.UNSET) for two
    authored objects;
  * the TRI-STATE - `provided` is a third value, NOT a synonym for "denied": it is dropped from
    the default view (RoleRightsReader.isNonDefault is the eIsSet filter) and shows as `default`
    only under `full: true`. Any assertion about a PROVIDED cell therefore REQUIRES `full: true` -
    without it the assertion passes vacuously, because the row is absent either way;
  * `roleObjectOffset` - the matrix is paged by OBJECT in the default view and the offset is
    ignored under `full: true`;
  * `language` - for a Role FQN the language CODE also selects the language of the RIGHT NAMES
    (RoleRightsReader.rightNameOf reads Right.getNameRu() for "ru", Right.getName() otherwise).
    Both fixtures declare a single Language.English with code `en`, so this bilingual read is the
    only assertion in the whole suite that can observe that wiring at all. The language is always
    chosen by CODE (`en` / `ru`), never by a language display name (CLAUDE.md don't #2);
  * the Object cell of a SUBORDINATE target (#685) - a right on `Catalog.<C>.Attribute.<A>` is
    listed under that full address, the form modify_metadata accepts in `rights[].object`, and the
    cell as read is written back to remove the right.

The whole-call negative matrix for this tool (missing projectName, missing/empty objectFqns, a
non-existent project, the per-object `## Errors` channel) lives in test_get_metadata_details.py and
is deliberately not repeated here; this file is the role-specific READ contract.

reset: kind="write-metadata" -> reset_fixture()+reset_model() after each test. These are reads, but
every one of them has to SEED the role it reads (see the fixture note), so they mutate the model and
must pay the full reset - a `kind="read"` test would leave the seeded role behind for the next test.

RUNNING THIS SLICE: `--filter role_rights`. run_all.py matches the filter against the TEST
NAME or the TOOL NAME, never the file name, so every test here is named
`test_role_rights_read_*`; the tool name `get_metadata_details` would otherwise be the only
handle and would drag in the whole base file. The same `role_rights` marker also selects the
write-side file, which is intended: the two are the two halves of #454 and the runner
executes them serially anyway.

FIXTURE TRUTH: the shipped TestConfiguration has NO Roles/ folder and no role at all, and only one
Catalog (Catalog.Catalog). Every test seeds what it needs under a unique name via create_metadata,
so nothing here depends on a role or a second object pre-existing.

PLATFORM TRUTH behind test_role_rights_read_matrix_renders_allowed_and_denied, read out of the
2026.2 bytecode of RightsModelUtil rather than assumed: AddRightValuesTask applies every cell
through `changeObjectRight(newValue, getDefaultRightValue(object, role), ...)`, which REFUSES
to create a cell whose value equals that default, and REMOVES an existing cell that drops onto
it (removeEmptyObjectRights then drops the whole `<object>` node once it empties). For a
NON-adopted top object in a base configuration that default is
`getRightValue(RoleDescription.isSetForNewObjects())`: with the flag false a `set` write lands
and an `unset` write is pruned to nothing, and with the flag true it is the other way round.
So a role cannot hold an `allowed` AND a `denied` cell written under one setting of that flag,
and the test flips `setForNewObjects` BETWEEN its two writes - which is why it spends four
modify_metadata calls instead of one. Ordering inside a single call cannot substitute:
RoleRightsWriter.apply runs rights[] BEFORE roleProperties, so a flag sent alongside the cells
arrives too late to change their default.

For a SUBORDINATE target (an attribute / tabular section / dimension / resource) the same default
comes from `RoleDescription.isSetForAttributesByDefault()` instead, and a role created by
create_metadata has that flag false too - so on a fresh role `unset` on an attribute IS the default
and is pruned. test_role_rights_read_attribute_row_carries_its_full_address relies on exactly
that; the measurement is recorded in test_modify_metadata_role_rights.py's module docstring
(WHAT THE PLATFORM DOES WITH A RIGHT VALUE).

def test_role_rights_read_attribute_row_carries_its_full_address():
    """A right on an ATTRIBUTE is listed under the attribute's full address, not the catalog's.

    The issue's reproduction (#685): a role grants Read on a catalog and View on one of its
    attributes. On disk Rights.rights holds two distinct `<object>` nodes, but the reader used to
    name a non-top target by its TOP object's FQN, so both rows read `Catalog.<C>` and the attribute
    row could not be told from a right on the catalog itself. The Object cell is now the address
    modify_metadata accepts in `rights[].object`, and the test proves that symmetry by feeding the
    cell it READ back into a write: `unset` on the attribute equals its default on a fresh role
    (setForAttributesByDefault is false - see this module's PLATFORM TRUTH, last paragraph), so the platform
    prunes the cell and drops the emptied object node, and the second read no longer lists it while
    the catalog's row stays.

    Cells are pinned whole (object + right + value), never as substrings: the catalog's FQN is a
    prefix of the attribute's address, so a substring check could not tell the two rows apart.
    Everything this test creates (catalog, attribute, role) is reverted by the write-metadata reset."""
