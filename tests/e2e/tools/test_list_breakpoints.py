"""
e2e tests for list_breakpoints (kind: read).

WHAT THIS TOOL ACTUALLY DOES (read ListBreakpointsTool.java):
  It enumerates the Eclipse workspace-level breakpoints via
  DebugPlugin.getDefault().getBreakpointManager().getBreakpoints() and returns a
  JSON result: {"success": true, "breakpoints": [ {...dto...} ], "count": N}.
  Line DTOs carry coordinates plus optional condition/hit-count fields. BSL
  exception DTOs are labelled workspaceWide and are always included. The
  OPTIONAL "projectName" argument filters line breakpoints only.

  Response type is JSON (getResponseType() == JSON), so the payload is in
  r.structured (NOT r.text тАФ text is only the bounded success digest).

ENVIRONMENT (no debug session / no running infobase тАФ that is the realistic case
here, and it is FINE for this tool):
  Unlike step/resume/evaluate_expression/wait_for_break, list_breakpoints does
  NOT need an active debug session or a running infobase. Breakpoints are stored
  in the Eclipse BREAKPOINT MANAGER (a workspace-level singleton), not inside the
  TestConfiguration project files and not inside a debug session. So the realistic
  HAPPY contract here is a genuine SUCCESS that reflects the breakpoint-manager
  state тАФ NOT a "no active debug session" sentinel. (The tool's ONLY error branch
  is `DebugPlugin == null` -> "DebugPlugin not available", which is unreachable in
  a live EDT workbench; there is no required parameter, no enum, no XOR.)

  Because of that, the happy path is exercised for real: we SET a breakpoint with
  the sibling set_breakpoint tool (also session-less тАФ it creates an Eclipse
  marker) on CommonModules/Calc/Module.bsl line 2, then list_breakpoints must read
  it back. We always REMOVE it again (remove_breakpoint) so the breakpoint manager
  is left as we found it. Throughout, assert_no_diff() holds: breakpoints live in
  the workspace, so a debug/breakpoint tool must NEVER modify the git-tracked
  project source.

NEGATIVE / EDGE MATRIX for an argument-free read tool:
  There is no missing-required-param case (no required params), no enum, no XOR.
  The meaningful edges are the FILTER semantics, which MUST be handled gracefully
  (success), not errored or mis-applied:
    - projectName filter that matches NO project -> success, our just-set line
      breakpoint absent, workspace-wide exception breakpoints retained.
    - projectName filter that matches -> our breakpoint present AND every
      non-workspace DTO belongs to that project (the filter really filters).
    - empty-string projectName -> treated as "no filter" (Java guards
      `!projectFilter.isEmpty()`), i.e. same as omitting it.
  See the per-test AUDIT note on why there is no is_error negative to assert.

Fixture inventory used (TestConfiguration, English Names):
  CommonModule.Calc -> src/CommonModules/Calc/Module.bsl (Function Add lines 1-3,
  Procedure Test lines 5-7); line 2 is inside Add and is a valid breakpoint line.
