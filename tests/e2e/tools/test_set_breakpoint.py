"""
e2e tests for set_breakpoint (kind: read).

What the tool does
------------------
set_breakpoint creates a 1C BSL line breakpoint via the Eclipse breakpoint
framework (SetBreakpointTool -> BreakpointUtils.createLineBreakpoint). It accepts
EITHER an EDT module-relative path ("CommonModules/Calc/Module.bsl") OR an
absolute filesystem path, plus a 1-based lineNumber.

ENVIRONMENT / WHY THIS IS STILL A REAL HAPPY PATH
-------------------------------------------------
Unlike the other debug/runtime tools (resume/step/evaluate_expression/...),
set_breakpoint does NOT require an active debug session or a running infobase.
A breakpoint is a workspace-level Eclipse artifact: it is registered on the
IBreakpointManager and its backing IMarker lives on the workspace resource, NOT
in the git-tracked TestConfiguration source tree. So against this EDT (no debug
session, no launched application) set_breakpoint genuinely SUCCEEDS тАФ and the
project working tree must stay clean. That is the realistic happy contract here,
so we exercise the real success path against the fixture's Calc module.

The breakpoint MAY come back "degraded" (marker-only) if the EDT BSL breakpoint
class is not on the runtime classpath тАФ BreakpointUtils falls back through EDT
marker types to a generic Eclipse marker and sets degraded=true + a warning. Both
the native and the degraded outcome are correct *successes*; we assert the parts
of the contract that hold in either case (success + echoed coordinates + a real
resolvedFile + a numeric breakpointId) and additionally assert that IF degraded,
the warning is present and actionable (so a silent degradation can't hide).

Response type / where the payload is
------------------------------------
getResponseType() == JSON, so the real payload is in r.structured
(structuredContent); r.text is only a "Done"/placeholder string. Success keys:
  breakpointId (long marker id), modulePath, module, resolvedFile, lineNumber,
  and on degraded: degraded=true + warning.

Real execute() error paths (SetBreakpointTool.java, all via ToolResult.error):
  - module/modulePath missing            -> "modulePath is required"
  - lineNumber < 1 (incl. omitted=-1)    -> "lineNumber must be >= 1"
  - module-relative path but no project  -> "projectName is required when
                                            modulePath is given as an EDT module path"
  - project BUILDING (module-rel only)   -> ProjectStateChecker.buildingErrorOrNull:
                                            "...building... Please wait and retry."
                                            (transient state ONLY; a missing/closed
                                            project falls THROUGH to the not-found branch)
  - file does not resolve/exist          -> "Module file not found: <module>
                                            [ in project <projectName>]" (a non-existent
                                            project lands here and IS named)

Fixture inventory used (TestConfiguration, English Names):
  CommonModule.Calc -> src/CommonModules/Calc/Module.bsl, with
    Function Add  on lines 1-3 (line 2 = "╨Т╨╛╨╖╨▓╤А╨░╤В A + B;", a real executable line)
    Procedure Test on lines 5-7
  This file is committed; line 2 is a deterministic, valid breakpoint target.

Cleanup note: a breakpoint set here lives in the EDT workspace (NOT the project
tree), so reset_fixture() does not remove it. The happy-path test therefore
removes its own breakpoint via remove_breakpoint at the end so the workspace does
not accumulate breakpoints across runs and the list_breakpoints read-back stays
deterministic. assert_no_diff() still proves the project source was untouched.
