e2e tests for delete_infobase (kind: action).

WHAT THE TOOL DOES
------------------
delete_infobase dissociates a FILE infobase from a configuration project and,
optionally, deregisters it from the global EDT Infobases list. It is the inverse
of create_infobase and the cleanup half of the create/delete round-trip.

Destructive, guarded by a confirm-preview: a bare call (confirm=false) reports what
would be removed WITHOUT changing anything; only confirm=true performs the removal.

RESPONSE SHAPE
--------------
JSON tool (getResponseType() == JSON); payload in r.structured:
  preview:  {"success": true, "action": "preview", "confirmationRequired": true,
             "project", "applicationId", "infobaseName", "deleteRegistration",
             ["databaseFilesKept"], "message"}
  deleted:  {"success": true, "action": "deleted", "project", "applicationId",
             "infobaseName", "deleteRegistration", "databaseFilesDeleted",
             ["databaseFilesKept"], "message"}
  error:    {"success": false, "error": "..."}

databaseFilesDeleted=false has six causes, and `databaseFilesKept` DECLARES which:
notRequested | noDirectory | shared | unknown | deleteFailed | deregistrationFailed.
It is absent exactly when the files were (or, on a preview, would be) deleted.
`shared` is a MEASURED co-owner; `unknown` is a shared-infobase check that did not
complete - it establishes nothing about sharing and is re-run by the next call.

CI STRATEGY
-----------
The negative matrix and confirm-gate tests are CI-safe (no platform needed). The
live happy-path (full create+delete round-trip) is covered by test_create_infobase.py
and gated behind EDT_MCP_LIVE_INFOBASE=1.

NOTE: delete_infobase never writes TestConfiguration source files. All calls
leave the project tree clean: assert_no_diff() on all paths.
