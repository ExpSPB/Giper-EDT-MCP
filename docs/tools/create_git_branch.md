# create_git_branch

Start isolated work on a new Git branch for an EDT project. Parameters and examples: get_tool_guide('create_git_branch').

## Parameters
| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| projectName | yes | string | EDT project whose git repository to branch (required). |
| branch | yes | string | New branch's short name (required); must not already exist. |
| startPoint | — | string | Existing branch, ref, or commit to start the new branch from. Optional; defaults to the current HEAD. |
| checkout | — | boolean | Check out the new branch immediately after creating it (bounded background Job, up to 120 s). Default FALSE - the branch is created and the working tree STAYS on the current branch, so later edits land there unless you pass true. |
| applicationId | — | string | Optional: application id from get_applications to attach to the new branch's context (the base is FOR this branch). |
| setDefault | — | boolean | Only with applicationId: also make it the DEFAULT infobase for the new branch's context. Default false. |

## Guide
Create a new local git branch - the non-UI sibling of EDT's own "New Branch" command - optionally check it out immediately, and optionally attach an EXISTING infobase to the new branch's context in the same call.

## Parameters
- `branch` is the new branch's SHORT name; it must NOT already exist (checked via `Repository.findRef` before anything else runs - a name that resolves to an existing local branch, remote-tracking branch, or tag is rejected, naming the ref it collided with).
- `startPoint` (optional) is an existing branch, tag, or commit to branch from; defaults to the current HEAD. An unresolvable value is rejected naming it.
- `checkout` (default false): after creating the branch, check it out immediately via the same bounded background Job `switch_git_branch` uses (up to 120 s).
- `applicationId` (optional, from `get_applications`): attach this EXISTING infobase to the NEW branch's context - equivalent to calling `set_branch_infobase` right after this call, but in one round trip. The base is bound to the context of the created ref, `refs/heads/<branch>` - the key EDT itself reads for the checked-out branch, so EDT picks the binding up on checkout, and `update_database` / `get_applications` honour it - regardless of whether `checkout` was also requested.
- `setDefault` (only meaningful with `applicationId`, default false): also make the attached application the branch context's default infobase. EDT records a default only for an infobase that is also bound to the CHECKED-OUT branch, so it takes effect together with `checkout: true` (the binding is made after the checkout). Without a checkout - unless the checked-out branch already has this base bound - the base is still attached and `bound` is still reported, but `message` says the default was not recorded - set it with `set_branch_infobase` once the branch is checked out. `bound.defaultInfobase` shows EDT's actual default: with a single bound base EDT reports that base even when no default was recorded.

## What happens on success
Once `branch` itself is created, that is FINAL - nothing after it can turn the result into a total failure. The result is:
```json
{ "success": true, "branch": "feature/x", "created": true, "checkedOut": true,
  "startPoint": "HEAD", "bound": { "infobases": ["MyBase"], "defaultInfobase": "MyBase" } }
```
- `checkedOut` is `true` only when `checkout` was requested AND the checkout completed cleanly. If checkout was requested but timed out, was interrupted, or left conflicts, `checkedOut` is `false` and `message` explains why - **the branch still exists**, it is simply not the one checked out.
- `bound` is present only when `applicationId` was given AND the binding succeeded; a resolution or association failure (application not found, no infobase reference, association-manager error) instead appends to `message` and omits `bound` - again, the branch itself is unaffected. A default EDT refuses after a successful attach (see `setDefault`) appends to `message` too, but keeps `bound`: the attach stands.
- `startPoint` echoes what was actually used: the given value, or the literal `"HEAD"` when omitted.

## Notes & gotchas
- **Not gated by the destructive-consent dialog.** Creating a local branch is reversible (delete it, or simply never use it) and never opens a 1C infobase connection.
- The already-exists pre-check runs BEFORE any mutation, so a call against a colliding name is a pure no-op (nothing is created, nothing is touched) - safe to retry with a different name.
- If you only need to create the branch (no checkout, no binding), leave `checkout` and `applicationId` out; the call is then a thin wrapper over `Git.branchCreate()`.
- To bind an infobase to a branch WITHOUT creating it (e.g. the branch already exists), use `set_branch_infobase` instead.
- Combine with `switch_git_branch` for the general "switch to an existing branch" case - this tool is specifically for branches that do not exist yet.
