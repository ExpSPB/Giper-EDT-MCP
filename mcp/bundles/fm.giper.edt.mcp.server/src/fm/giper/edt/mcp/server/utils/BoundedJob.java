/**
 * Runs a unit of platform work in a background {@link Job} and waits for it with a hard
 * deadline, so an unattended MCP call can never be held open indefinitely by a wedged
 * platform operation.
 *
 * <p>Two layers of protection, but only ONE of them is always present:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the work receives the {@link Job}'s own {@link IProgressMonitor}, which is cancelled
 * when the deadline elapses — a platform call that polls its monitor (notably one waiting
 * for a conflicting scheduling rule) unwinds with {@code OperationCanceledException}. This
 * layer only exists for work that HAS a monitor to poll: {@code ApplicationSupport}'s six
 * bounded entry points wrap {@code IApplicationManager} calls that take no monitor at all
 * (EDT declares no such overload), so for every one of them this layer is inert by
 * construction and the deadline below is the whole guarantee;</li>
 * <li>the caller stops waiting at the deadline regardless — cancellation is cooperative and
 * cannot preempt code that never polls, so the bound on the CALLER is what actually
 * guarantees an answer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>A timed-out job usually keeps running.</b> Cancelling only asks it to stop; the caller
 * must report the timeout honestly rather than pretend the work was undone. The one exception is
 * a job the deadline caught while it was still QUEUED: cancelling it there stops it from ever
 * starting, and reporting THAT as "it may still be running" is the opposite of the truth — hence
 * the separate {@link Outcome#TIMED_OUT_BEFORE_START}.
 *
 * <p>The job is joined synchronously only until the caller's deadline. A caller whose unattended-
 * safety guard must outlive that bounded wait can use the completion-callback overload to release
 * the guard when the Job manager reports eventual completion.

         * {@code findBlockingJob}, and {@code jobQueued} always produces a worker for it, so it

     * Whether the just-cancelled {@code job} left the scheduler WITHOUT ever entering the work.
     *
     * <p>Deliberately NOT decided by {@link Job#cancel()}'s return value, which cannot answer this:
     * a job in {@code ABOUT_TO_RUN} is flagged {@code aboutToRunCanceled} and then never runs, yet
     * {@code cancel()} reports {@code false} for it exactly as it does for a job that is genuinely
     * running (see {@code JobManager.cancel} / {@code startJob} in org.eclipse.core.jobs). Using
     * that boolean would classify a rename that never began as one still in flight — the mistake
     * this method exists to avoid.
     *
     * <p>What DOES answer it is the scheduler itself: after {@code cancel()}, a job that was queued
     * (or refused at the start line) settles to {@code NONE} promptly, so a short {@code join}
     * returns {@code true}; a job that is really running keeps the join busy for the whole grace.
     * The work flag is then re-read to separate that from a job which finished in the race window
     * between the deadline and the cancel.
     *
     * @param job the cancelled job
     * @param enteredWork the flag the job body sets as its first statement
     * @return {@code true} only when the job is off the scheduler AND never entered the work
