/**
 * REFUSALS: the exceptions our own validation raises to reject bad input, as opposed to the
 * failures the platform raises when something is actually broken. A refusal is the tool working
 * correctly, so it is logged at {@link IStatus#INFO} WITHOUT a stack.
 * <p>
 * INFO rather than WARNING because the actionable text is ALREADY in the log at WARNING: every
 * tools/call that ends in an error logs {@code "Failed tools/call: <tool> - <message>"} once
 * (see {@code McpProtocolHandler}). A second WARNING per refusal would only move the noise one
 * severity down and make the WARNING band the next thing a triage has to hand-sort. What this
 * entry adds is the internal code path, which is a debugging breadcrumb.
 * <p>
 * The discriminator is an explicit MARKER set where the refusal is raised ({@link #state} /
 * {@link #argument}), never the exception class: {@code IllegalStateException} is raised both by
 * our validation and by the platform, so demoting by class would hide a genuine platform defect
 * at exactly the moment it starts happening. Anything UNMARKED therefore keeps
 * {@link IStatus#ERROR} and its stack - see {@link #statusFor}.
 * <p>
 * The marked exceptions stay subtypes of {@code IllegalStateException} /
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException} and carry the message verbatim, so every existing
 * {@code catch} clause and every client-visible message is unaffected: only the log level changes.
 * <p>
 * The ready-JSON refusal {@link FormValidationException} is a {@link Marker} too, so a path whose
 * catch block does not short-circuit on {@link FormValidationException#jsonOf} still logs it as
 * the refusal it is.
