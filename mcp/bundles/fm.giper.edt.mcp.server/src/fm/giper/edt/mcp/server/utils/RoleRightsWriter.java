/**
 * Writes a {@link Role}'s access rights (the {@code modify_metadata} Role branch): per-object right
 * VALUES, per-object Row-Level-Security (RLS) restriction conditions with optional per-field
 * resolution, RLS restriction TEMPLATES, and the three role properties.
 *
 * <p>The mutation is performed through the EDT-native BM tasks ({@code AddRightValuesTask},
 * {@code AddRlsTask} / {@code EditRlsTask}, {@code AddRlsTemplateTask} / {@code EditRlsTemplateTask}
 * / {@code DeleteRlsTemplateTask}, {@code SetIndependentRightsOfChildObjectsTask}) which each open
 * their own BM transaction ({@code bmModel.execute(task)}), never a hand-rolled model edit. The
 * caller ({@code ModifyMetadataTool}) then force-exports BOTH the {@code Role.<Name>} FQN AND the
 * {@link RoleDescription}'s OWN top-object FQN (carried out of the apply as {@link Result#rightsFqn}),
 * OUTSIDE any boundary, after every task has run: the rights matrix lives in its OWN BM resource
 * ({@code Rights.rights}), so exporting only the role FQN would drain {@code Role.mdo} but never
 * {@code Rights.rights}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The concrete rights matrix lives on {@link RoleDescription} (a subtype of the mdclass
 * {@link AbstractRoleDescription} the bare {@code Role.getRights()} may hold). Every rights task
 * requires the {@link RoleDescription} to already exist, so {@link #ensureRoleDescription} seeds one
 * in a {@link BmTransactions#write write} boundary before the tasks run when the role has none - and
 * REGISTERS it as a BM top object in that same boundary (see {@link #attachRoleDescription}); a
 * description that is only referenced and never attached fails the very next commit with
 * {@code Failed to persist reference value ...RoleDescriptionImpl@<hash>} (issue #452).</p>
 *
 * <p>The value / name / payload helpers are pure (no model, no UI) so they are unit-testable; the
 * model-touching apply methods run on the UI thread and go only through the BM boundary.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Best-effort, non-atomic apply.</b> The payload is validated up front for shape errors (fail
 * fast, nothing written), but each entry is applied through its own BM task ({@code bmModel.execute}
 * per right value / RLS / template / role property), so there is no single rollback across entries. A
 * mid-run RESOLUTION failure (e.g. an {@code edit} / {@code delete} template whose name is not found,
 * or an unknown RLS field) fails the operation AFTER earlier entries have already committed - those
 * earlier entries stay applied. Order entries so any risky reference (edit/delete templates, RLS
 * fields) is validated by the caller before the batch, or accept that a partial mutation may remain
 * on failure.</p>

     * that carries it dies with {@code Failed to persist reference value
     * ...RoleDescriptionImpl@<hash>}. Registering it with
     * {@link IBmTransaction#attachTopObject(IBmObject, String) attachTopObject} in the SAME transaction
     * that sets the reference is the cure - the same shape {@code XdtoWriter.resolvePackageContent} and

     * FIRST, the FQN is generated SECOND, the attach happens THIRD. Generating the FQN before the
     * reference is set makes {@code attachTopObject} <i>appear</i> to succeed - no exception, the
     * reference reads back fine within the model - while never durably registering the object under
     * that FQN; that exact regression is written up in {@code XdtoWriter.resolvePackageContent}.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>The FQN comes from the generator, never from the object and never from the name.</b>
     * {@code bmGetFqn()} is not called here and must not be reintroduced: it throws
     * {@code BmAssertionException} on an object the same transaction has just attached, which would
     * turn already-applied work into a reported failure. The measured registry string
     * {@code Role.<Name>.Rights} is this generator's OUTPUT, not an input - do not concatenate it.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>The reuse guard is "BM has attached it AND it is a top object"</b> - not
     * {@code instanceof RoleDescription} alone, and not {@code bmIsTop()} alone: a bare
     * {@link AbstractRoleDescription}, and a concrete description BM never registered, both need a
     * fresh, attached one. {@code bmIsTransient()} is asked FIRST, and it is not decoration - it is
     * the only half of the predicate that can see the #452 state. (Measured on EDT 2026.2,
     * {@code com._1c.g5.v8.bm.core.BmObject}: {@code bmIsTop()} is
     * {@code bmIsTransient() ? eContainer() == null : isFullTopObjectId(id)}, and {@code Role.rights}
     * is declared {@code refers} - a NON-containment reference - so {@code setRights} never gives the
     * description an {@code eContainer}. A description that was created and assigned but never
     * attached therefore answers {@code bmIsTop() == true}, which is exactly the unpersistable value
     * this bootstrap exists to replace; trusting {@code bmIsTop()} alone would hand it straight back
     * to the next commit.)</p>
     *
     * <p><b>An FQN collision is refused, never resolved.</b> The disk importer registers exactly this
     * FQN too, and stale {@code .Rights} entries outlive their roles. Adopting the incumbent would
     * silently rewire the role's matrix to an object we did not create; detaching it would destroy an
     * existing matrix. Refusing does neither. What the refusal may SAY is bounded by what was
     * observed: {@code tx.getTopObjectByFqn(fqn) != null} shows the name is taken, and nothing more -
     * it does not tell a stale leftover apart from a live registration this role's reference has not
     * resolved to yet, so the message offers {@code clean_project} as the remedy for the stale case
     * instead of asserting that the case IS stale. For the same reason it names no OWNER for the
