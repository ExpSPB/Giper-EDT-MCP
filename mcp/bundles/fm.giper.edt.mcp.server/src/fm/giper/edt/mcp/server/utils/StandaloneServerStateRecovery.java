/**
 * Recovers the one standalone-server state EDT cannot recover from on its own: a server whose
 * WST state is still {@code STARTED} while the launch that owned it has ended.
 *
 * <h2>What goes wrong</h2>
 * EDT starts a standalone server only from the {@code STOPPED} state — its behaviour delegate
 * refuses anything else with the literal sentence this class matches. The state is set back to
 * {@code STOPPED} by a handler that runs when the {@code ibsrv} PROCESS is confirmed gone, and
 * that confirmation is bounded: EDT polls the process handle for a few seconds and, if the
 * process is still listed (a slow teardown, a loaded machine) or the waiting thread is
 * interrupted (a cancelled operation), it gives up WITHOUT running the handler. The launch,
 * meanwhile, reports itself terminated the moment the process object dies, and a WST server
 * hands out only a live launch — so from that point on:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the server state says {@code STARTED};</li>
 *   <li>the server's launch is gone, so EDT's "it is already running, nothing to do" shortcut
 *       does not apply;</li>
 *   <li>every start attempt — a launch, or the publish inside a database update — reaches the
 *       delegate and is refused.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Nothing clears it by itself: EVERY subsequent launch/update of that application fails, with a
 * message ("Can only start server that is stopped but current server state is 2") that names an
 * internal state number and no action. Stopping the server explicitly is the documented way out,
 * and that is what {@link #stopStaleServer(IProject, String)} does through EDT's own API.
 *
 * <h2>Why a stop is safe here</h2>
 * The server being stopped is one EDT has already lost track of: it holds no live launch, so no
 * debug session or client is attached to it through EDT. The stop mutates no infobase data — it
 * only returns EDT's own bookkeeping to {@code STOPPED} so the operation the caller asked for can
 * proceed. A server process that outlived EDT's bookkeeping may still be holding the configured
 * ports; that surfaces as the ordinary port-conflict answer on the retry, which names the ports.
