/**
 * Recovers the one standalone-server state EDT cannot recover from on its own: a server whose
 * WST state is still {@code STARTED} while the launch that owned it has ended.
 *
 * <h2>What goes wrong</h2>
 * EDT starts a standalone server only from the {@code STOPPED} state — its behaviour delegate
 * refuses anything else with the literal sentence this class matches. The state is set back to
 * {@code STOPPED} by a handler that runs when the {@code ibsrv} PROCESS is confirmed gone, and
 * that confirmation is bounded: EDT polls the process handle for a few seconds and, if the
 * process is still listed (a slow teardown, a loaded machine) or the waiting thread is
 * interrupted (a cancelled operation), it gives up WITHOUT running the handler. The launch,
 * meanwhile, reports itself terminated the moment the process object dies, and a WST server
 * hands out only a live launch — so from that point on:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the server state says {@code STARTED};</li>
 *   <li>the server's launch is gone, so EDT's "it is already running, nothing to do" shortcut
 *       does not apply;</li>
 *   <li>every start attempt — a launch, or the publish inside a database update — reaches the
 *       delegate and is refused.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Nothing clears it by itself: EVERY subsequent launch/update of that application fails, with a
 * message ("Can only start server that is stopped but current server state is 2") that names an
 * internal state number and no action. Stopping the server explicitly is the documented way out,
 * and that is what {@link #stopStaleServer(IProject, String)} does through EDT's own API.
 *
 * <h2>Why a stop is safe here</h2>
 * The server being stopped is one EDT has already lost track of: it holds no live launch, so no
 * debug session or client is attached to it through EDT. The stop mutates no infobase data — it
 * only returns EDT's own bookkeeping to {@code STOPPED} so the operation the caller asked for can
 * proceed. A server process that outlived EDT's bookkeeping may still be holding the configured
 * ports; that surfaces as the ordinary port-conflict answer on the retry, which names the ports.
 *
 * <h2>Two moments, one repair</h2>
 * The same stop is applied at two moments, and both are needed:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #ensureStartable(IProject, IApplication, String)} runs BEFORE the operation and
 *       is what keeps the failure from happening at all — including the workbench-log stack
 *       trace EDT writes even when the retry succeeds (the refusal escapes a WST job, and the
 *       job framework logs it);</li>
 *   <li>{@link #launchWithRecovery} / {@link #updateWithRecovery} keep the reactive repair for
 *       what a pre-flight cannot see: a state that goes stale between the check and the start,
 *       and any refusal reaching a path the pre-flight could not resolve.</li>
 * </ul>

     * {@link #launchWithRecovery} and {@link #updateWithRecovery} repair the stale state AFTER EDT
     * refuses, and the operation then succeeds. What they cannot repair is the noise: the refusal
     * is thrown inside WST's start job, whose {@code startImpl} catches only {@link CoreException},
     * so the {@link IllegalStateException} escapes the job and the Eclipse job framework writes the
     * whole stack into the workbench log — even when the retry that follows succeeds. An unattended
     * run accumulates ERROR entries that describe nothing the caller can act on. Deciding BEFORE
     * the start means the refusal never happens, so nothing is logged.
     *
     * <p>The check mirrors EDT's OWN "it is already running, nothing to do" condition
     * ({@code StandaloneServerService.startServer}): a server counts as running only when its state
     * is {@code STARTED} AND it still holds a live launch. That is deliberate — a server whose
     * launch is gone is exactly the one EDT refuses, and a server that still holds one is exactly
     * the one EDT leaves alone.
     *
     * <p>It never fails an operation for its own reasons: any failure to READ the state (an EDT
     * without the standalone-server feature, a changed API, a server that cannot be resolved)
     * leaves the call to proceed exactly as before, where the reactive recovery still covers it.
     * The single exception is deliberate - a stop that MAY STILL BE RUNNING, where proceeding
     * would start a server the lingering stop can take down again.
     *

     * @param application the application, when the caller already holds it (may be {@code null} —
     *     it is then resolved from {@code applicationId})
     * @param applicationId the application id; anything but a standalone-server id
     *     ({@code ServerApplication.<name>}) is a no-op
     * @throws ApplicationException when a stop of that server did not finish - this call's own,
