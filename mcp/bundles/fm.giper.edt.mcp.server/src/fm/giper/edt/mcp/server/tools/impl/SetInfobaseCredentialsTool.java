/**
 * Stores the <em>infobase connection credentials</em> (user/password) EDT uses
 * to authenticate the designer agent for {@code update_database} and
 * {@code launch} against an infobase that requires user authentication
 * (issue #194) — including a standalone-server ({@code wst-server}) application
 * wrapping an already-registered infobase (issue #275).
 *
 * <p>Without stored credentials the update agent is started without the infobase
 * user and fails to authenticate, popping a blocking "Configure Infobase access
 * Settings" dialog that hangs the unattended call. This tool reports the UUID-keyed
 * storage target and what the same consumer-facing resolver reads back.
 *
 * <p>These credentials select an <b>existing</b> infobase user — they do NOT
 * create users. Demo bases typically have a user with an empty password, so an
 * empty {@code password} is valid.
 *
 * <p><strong>Two consumers, two stores (issue #359).</strong> The infobase access
 * settings above are read by the designer AGENT. The 1C CLIENT a launch starts is a
 * different process and reads its user from the launch configuration's own attributes,
 * so a target given as {@code launchConfigurationName} configures BOTH — see
 * {@link #configureClient}. A target given as {@code projectName} + {@code applicationId}
 * names no launch configuration, so only the agent is configured and the success message
 * says so: otherwise a caller reads {@code success:true} and is surprised by the
 * platform's login dialog on the next {@code run_yaxunit_tests} / {@code launch}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Unattended-safety:</strong> the model work (resolve application -&gt;
 * {@link InfobaseAccessSupport#storeCredentials(IApplication, String, String, InfobaseAccess)}
 * -&gt; settings read-back -&gt; display-name read-back) runs in a
 * bounded background Eclipse Job joined with a short {@link #CREDENTIALS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}-second
 * timeout — never on the UI thread. Resolving an application can provoke EDT's background
 * application-update-state recompute, which can loop for a long time on an unbounded worker
 * thread; the bounded Job guarantees the call returns. The persistent write is recorded before
 * read-back begins, and a conclusive or honestly inconclusive verification refines it before the
 * cosmetic name read-back.
 *
 * <p>A Job that outran the deadline is cancelled, but cancellation is cooperative and this one has
 * no monitor poll to honour it, so it keeps running. It therefore checks — on the writing side —
 * whether the caller has already been answered before it touches the launch configuration: a call
 * that reported a failure must not leave a user and a password behind it.

     * its user from the launch configuration's own attributes, so writing only the former leaves the
     * client popping the platform's "Infobase access" dialog at every launch — a call that reported

     *
     * <p>Called on BOTH target shapes, on purpose. "No launch configuration was named" is a value
     * this method returns, not a call site that quietly does not exist, so the one place that
     * decides whether the client is configured is testable for both answers.
     *
     * <p>It runs only AFTER the agent's credentials have committed. There is no transaction across
     * EDT's secure storage and a launch configuration, so one of the two writes is always second —
     * but this way the second one's failure is REPORTED ({@code clientConfigured:false} plus the
     * reason), whereas the reverse order would leave a launch configuration silently rewritten by a
     * call that answered {@code success:false}.

     * joined with a bounded timeout; when that deadline elapses the caller is answered and

     * stop a Job that is inside {@code getApplication}/{@code storeCredentials}. The Job therefore
     * reaches this point regardless, which is why the check lives HERE, on the side that writes: an
     * answered call must not go on to put a user and a password into a launch configuration behind
