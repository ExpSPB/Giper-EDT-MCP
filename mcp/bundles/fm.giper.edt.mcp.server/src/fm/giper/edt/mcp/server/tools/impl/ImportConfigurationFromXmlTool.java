/**
 * Tool that wraps the EDT "Import &rarr; Configuration from XML Files" action.
 *
 * <p>Imports a configuration from a directory of XML source files into a new
 * EDT project in the workspace. The reverse of
 * {@link ExportConfigurationToXmlTool}.
 *
 * <p>Wraps {@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.cli.api.workspace.IImportConfigurationFilesApi}
 * via reflection so this bundle has no build-time dependency on the API
 * package.
 *
 * <h2>Why the import alone does not produce a usable project (issue #647)</h2>
 *
 * <p>The CLI API creates and opens the {@link IProject}, then calls
 * {@code IDtProjectResourceLifecycleBootstrap.registerImport(project)}, which parks a MANUAL
 * start latch with {@code startAllowed = false} on it, and runs the import operation
 * synchronously. For a CONFIGURATION that operation is {@code ImportObjectsOperation} - the one
 * EDT import operation that never calls {@code permitImport}, and the CLI API does not call it
 * either. Nothing therefore releases the latch: the project's context is never started,
 * {@code IDtProjectManager.getDtProject(p)} stays {@code null} forever, {@code list_projects}
 * reports {@code not_available}, and - because a blocked latch also stops EDT's
 * {@code DefaultContextsStartJob} from being scheduled at all - context startup of every OTHER
 * project in the workspace stalls with it.
 *
 * <p>{@code setRefreshProject(false)}, which the CLI API also sets, is a SEPARATE and much
 * smaller thing: it skips only the platform's own {@code IProject.refreshLocal(DEPTH_INFINITE)}
 * after the import. It has nothing to do with DtProject registration - the javadoc that used to
 * blame it for the {@code not_available} state was wrong, and so was the close/open/refresh
 * sequence added on the strength of it: a close removes the latch, but the re-open only starts
 * the project when Eclipse emits a POST_CHANGE delta carrying the {@code OPEN} flag, which a
 * batched close+open does not produce.
 *
 * <p>So the project is started EXPLICITLY, exactly the way EDT's own headless command for this
 * API ({@code ImportConfigurationFilesCmd}) does it: refresh the workspace tree and - only when
 * the project is not already started - ask
 * {@link IWorkspaceOrchestrator#startWorkspaceProjects} for a {@link ProjectStartType#CLEAN_IMPORT}
 * start, then wait - within a bounded budget - until EDT reports the project started AND knows
 * its DtProject. The answer states what was
 * observed: {@code state: ready} when EDT started the project, {@code state: importing} when the
 * budget ran out first (a success, because the files ARE imported and the project name IS taken -
 * an error would push the caller into a re-import that can only fail).
 *
 * <p><b>{@code permitImport} is NOT part of that happy path</b>, and EDT's own command does not
 * call it either. Releasing the latch BEFORE the start request arms a second, competing start:
 * {@code manuallyLockedProjectsExist()} turns false, EDT's watchdog schedules
 * {@code DefaultContextsStartJob}, and that job issues its own {@code startWorkspaceProjects} for
 * the same project - which the {@code !isStarted} gate cannot see, because it has already
 * answered. It is therefore called only as a RECOVERY, when no start of ours is coming: after the
 * post-import step itself threw - the workspace refresh, or the start request (the
 * {@code isStarted} gate or {@code startWorkspaceProjects}) - or when the step is abandoned before
 * it started (the bounded job never entered it, or could not be scheduled at all). An abandoned
 * step is claimed by the caller through an ownership token the job body must claim first, so a
 * job that runs late does nothing and our own start cannot follow the release. The watchdog is
 * then the only remaining route to a started project, and the release also un-freezes context
 * startup for every OTHER project in the workspace.

     *
     * <p>Order is load-bearing and is what the pins protect: the workspace refresh the CLI API
     * disabled happens FIRST, so the start sees the imported files rather than an empty tree; and
     * the start request is issued ONLY for a project EDT has not started, because
     * {@code startWorkspaceProjects} begins by STOPPING the contexts of dependent projects.
     * {@code permitImport} is deliberately absent from this path - see the class javadoc - and is
     * called only when no start of ours is coming: the refresh or the start request itself threw,
     * or the step was abandoned before it started ({@link #abandonTheStep}: the bounded job never
     * entered it, or scheduling it threw).
     *
     * <p>All of it runs inside a {@link BoundedJob}, because
     * {@code refreshLocal(DEPTH_INFINITE)} over a large configuration and
     * {@code startWorkspaceProjects} are both minutes of platform work that must never hold the
     * MCP dispatcher thread.
     *
     * <p><b>But the deadline must not CANCEL that work.</b> {@link BoundedJob} cancels the job on
     * expiry, which only sets its monitor's flag - the body keeps running - so a platform call
     * that polls the monitor would unwind with {@code OperationCanceledException} and the steps
     * behind it would never run at all. On a large dump the refresh alone can outlive the budget,
     * and cancelling it there would mean the start request is never issued while the answer still
     * tells the caller to wait for a project that will never start: issue #647, reinstated and
     * hidden. The platform calls therefore receive a monitor that never reports cancellation, and
     * ONLY the poll loop is bounded; the job runs the refresh and the start to completion in the
     * background. What the answer says is decided by how far the step had got
     * ({@link StartPhase}), not by how the wait ended - and the phase is advanced when a platform
     * call is ENTERED, not when it returns, because either call can be the one still running at
     * the deadline.
     *
     * <p>A failure the step raises AFTER the deadline has nowhere to go: the caller has already
     * been answered {@code state: importing} and told to poll, and {@link BoundedJob} never reads
     * its failure holder on that path. It is therefore logged from the job thread itself - with
     * the project and the step it failed in - and rethrown unchanged. Before the deadline nothing
     * is logged: the failure reaches the caller as the {@link StartPhase#FAILED} /
     * {@link StartPhase#REFRESH_FAILED} verdict, which is the caller's to act on.

     * scheduling failure carries no outcome at all. Left alone, the MANUAL latch the CLI import
     * parked would stand for the rest of the EDT session, and while it stands EDT's watchdog schedules
     * {@code DefaultContextsStartJob} for NO project in the workspace. So this is the third and
     * last release site, and the same class as the other two: no start of ours is coming, the
     * watchdog is the only route left, and the release cannot arm a start that competes with ours
     * because ours was never issued.
     *
     * <p>A release that itself throws does not change the verdict. The answer already sends the
     * caller to close and reopen the project in EDT, which drops the latch on close regardless;
     * the failure is logged so an operator can see why the watchdog did not recover by itself.
