/**
 * Shared resolution for the application/infobase tools ({@code get_applications},
 * {@code update_database}, …): resolves an OPEN project plus the EDT
 * {@code IApplicationManager}, returning the same actionable errors those tools
 * used inline. The application-domain counterpart to
 * {@link ProjectContext#resolveConfiguration(String)}.
 *
 * <h2>Bounded application reads</h2>
 * {@code getApplication} / {@code getDefaultApplication} / {@code getApplications} have NO
 * overload taking an {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor} or a timeout, and all
 * three funnel into {@code ApplicationManager.getApplications}, which loops the provision
 * delegates; the WST delegate reaches {@code ServerCore.getServers()} →
 * {@code ResourceManager.init()}, a {@code synchronized} method that runs arbitrary
 * {@code IStartup} contributions. A slow contribution parks that monitor and every later read
 * blocks on it UNINTERRUPTIBLY. The only way to bound such a read is therefore to move it off
 * the caller's thread — see {@link #readBounded}.
 *
 * <h2>None of the three reads is side-effect-free</h2>
 * Read off EDT's own sources, not assumed. All three end in the infobase provision delegate's
 * {@code initIfNeeded}, which ASSIGNS a debug port to an application that has none: it scans up
 * to a hundred candidate ports by actually BINDING a {@code ServerSocket} on each, then stores
 * the winner through {@code setAttribute}, which flushes the preference store. The
 * default-application read adds one more — a registered default that no longer resolves is
 * cleared with an unconditional {@code setDefaultApplication(project, null)} remove.
 *
 * <p>So an abandoned read is not merely a question left unanswered: it can bind sockets, persist
 * a debug port and erase a stored default AFTER the caller has returned. Every message about an
 * expired deadline here therefore says the state MAY HAVE BEEN MUTATED — never that nothing
 * happened.
