Lists or terminates live sessions reported by `ibcmd` for a running EDT standalone-server application.

## Scope and reachability

This tool works only with applications whose EDT type is `wst-server` (standalone server). It uses the runtime and live process owned by EDT; it does not inspect file-infobase or client/server applications.

`action='list'` has three meaningful outcomes plus one refusal:

- `reachable=true` with one or more `sessions` — the list was read;
- `reachable=true` with `sessions=[]` — the list was read and proves there are no sessions;
- `reachable=false` with `unreachableReason` and no `sessions` field — the application is the wrong type, the standalone server is not running, the runtime is unknown, `ibcmd` is missing, or the command failed.

The fourth is structurally different: `success=false` with no `reachable` field at all, when the application lookup or the infobase lock did not conclude inside its bound. Nothing was listed or terminated, and whether the application exists was never established — it is neither `reachable=true` nor `reachable=false`. Passing `applicationId` explicitly skips the wedge-prone default-application lookup.

Never interpret `reachable=false` as an empty session list. Fix the named reason or decide explicitly whether the caller can proceed without proof.

Each session reports `sessionId` (full UUID), `sessionNumber` (numeric `session-id`), raw `applicationKind` (`app-id`), `userName`, `host`, `startedAt`, `lastActiveAt`, and `applicationKindIsDesigner`.

There is no OS process id: `ibcmd` leaves the `process` and `connection` fields empty for standalone-server sessions, so none is reported. Terminating the session ends the client process it belongs to, which is what a process id would have been used for.

## The ambiguous Designer session

An `app-id: Designer` session can be EDT's configurator/update agent OR a human Configurator; EDT exposes no discriminator, so the tool cannot tell them apart. `applicationKindIsDesigner=true` reports the raw application kind without claiming EDT ownership.

Treating every Designer session as a blocker would refuse every normal EDT update. For that reason `update_database` does not block on it and `all=true` always skips it. You can terminate one only as an explicit per-id act using its exact full session UUID. If it is EDT's agent, EDT re-creates it on its next connect; an update running at the moment you terminate it can fail.

## Parameters

- `projectName` (required) — the EDT configuration project.
- `applicationId` — an ID from `get_applications`; omitted means the project's default application.
- `action` — `list` (default) or `terminate`.
- `sessionId` — for `terminate`, either the full UUID or numeric session number returned by `list`. A Designer session requires its exact full UUID.
- `all` — for `terminate`, `true` selects every non-agent session. Use exactly one of `sessionId` or `all=true`. A bulk terminate is bounded overall, not just per command, so it can stop before reaching the whole selection. Its verdict comes from the list re-read afterwards, not from the selection taken before it ran: `outstandingCount` and `outstandingSessionIds` report every non-agent session that list still shows, whether the budget never reached it or it connected while the call was running, and a session that left on its own is not reported at all. A non-empty result is an error, and the continuation is to terminate those ids individually - re-running `all=true` re-selects any session that survived a terminate, which could spend the next budget on it again and never reach the rest.
- `confirm` — must be `true` for `terminate`.
- `message` — optional text passed to `ibcmd --error-message` and shown to the terminated user. It must not contain a NUL character (U+0000): the platform refuses such an argument, so the call is rejected up front rather than failing with an unknown outcome.

## Examples

List before updating:

```text
infobase_sessions(action='list', projectName='MyProject', applicationId='ServerApplication.MyServer')
```

Terminate one non-agent session by its numeric ID:

```text
infobase_sessions(action='terminate', projectName='MyProject', applicationId='ServerApplication.MyServer', sessionId='42', confirm=true, message='Database maintenance is starting')
```

Clear all non-agent sessions before retrying `update_database`:

```text
infobase_sessions(action='terminate', projectName='MyProject', applicationId='ServerApplication.MyServer', all=true, confirm=true)
```

Termination is verified, not assumed. `ibcmd` exits 0 even for a session UUID that no longer exists, so the tool re-reads the session list afterwards and reports only sessions observed gone. `verification` says which happened:

- `verified` — every targeted session is absent from the re-read list;
- `mismatched` — a session is still present after a terminate that reported success; this is an error. Surviving non-Designer sessions still block an update, while surviving Designer sessions are not treated as blockers by `update_database`;
- `not_verifiable` — the list could not be re-read, with `verificationReason` naming why it could not be checked. When `ibcmd` accepted one or more commands, `attemptedCount` names how many. `sessions` and `terminatedCount` are omitted because none was observed gone; list again before treating the infobase as clear.

If a termination command fails before the list is re-read, the error carries `mutationOutcomeUnknown=true` because the command may have changed state before failing. It also carries `verification: not_verifiable` with a `verificationReason`; a failure later in a multi-session sequence includes `attemptedCount` for the earlier accepted commands. `mutationCommitted`, `terminatedCount`, and `sessions` are absent because no read-back confirmed which targeted sessions are gone; list again to learn the current state.
