Pauses a debug session that is already running and returns where it is executing: the suspended thread and its call stack, in the same shape `wait_for_break` returns. It is the active counterpart of `resume` - use it when code is running (slow, looping, or apparently hung) and no breakpoint was set in the right place beforehand.

## When to use
- A debugged operation takes too long and you need to see which line it is on right now.
- You want to inspect variables of running code without knowing where to put a breakpoint.

## Parameter details
- `applicationId` - the debug session, in any form `resume` / `wait_for_break` accept (real id, `attach:<configName>`, `launch:<configName>`, `ServerApplication.<app>`). **Optional** only when exactly one live debug target exists and no other debug launch is starting; otherwise it errors - list them with `debug_status`. A client launched against a debug-mode standalone server can show as two targets (the client's and the server's), which pause different code, so pass the id there.
- `timeout` - seconds to wait for the pause to take effect (default 10, capped at 600).

## What you get
- **Paused:** `paused: true`, `state: "suspended"`, `threadId`, `threadName`, `frames` (each with `frameIndex`, `frameRef`, `name`, `line`, and for BSL frames `modulePath` + `project`) and `topFrameRef`. `alreadySuspended: true` means the session was already paused (e.g. at a breakpoint), so no request was sent and the existing stop point is returned.
- **Not paused in time:** `paused: false`, `state: "running"`, `reason: "timeout"`. 1C pauses at the NEXT BSL statement it executes, so an idle session (a client waiting for user input) does not stop until code runs; the request stays armed. Catch the pause with `wait_for_break` - do not call `debug_pause` again.
- **Ended:** `paused: false`, `state: "terminated"` - the session ended before or while pausing.

## Notes & gotchas
- Feed `topFrameRef` to `get_variables` / `evaluate_expression`, use `threadId` for `step`, and `resume` to let the code continue. The frame's `modulePath` + `project` chain into `read_module_source`.
- The pause stops whichever thread of the session runs BSL next. A debug-mode standalone server carries the threads of the clients connected to it, so `threadName` says what stopped, and the returned `applicationId` is the session's canonical id, which can differ from the one passed.
- A pause is not a breakpoint: nothing is left behind once you `resume`.
- An error carrying `mutationOutcomeUnknown: true` means the suspend request itself failed midway, so whether the session paused is unknown - check with `debug_status` or `wait_for_break`.
