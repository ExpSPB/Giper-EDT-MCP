Dumps the configuration to a `.cf` file, or one configuration extension to a `.cfe` file, FROM an application's infobase - the headless equivalent of EDT's "Export configuration to file" wizard. The 1C Designer (thick client) of the platform EDT resolves for the project and infobase writes the file.

## When to use
- You need a `.cf` / `.cfe` deliverable: a release artifact, a file to load into another infobase, a snapshot for support.
- Use `export_configuration_to_xml` instead when you want the PROJECT's sources as XML files. This tool reads the INFOBASE, so the file holds what the infobase contains, not the unsaved or unpublished state of the project.

## Parameter details
- `projectName` (required) - a configuration project, or an extension project. An extension project exports THAT extension: the dump is taken from the infobase of its base configuration project's application, and `extensionName` may be omitted.
- `outputFile` (required) - the absolute path of the file to create. It must end in `.cf` for a configuration and `.cfe` for an extension, its folder must already exist, and the file must NOT exist: the tool never replaces a file. Pass a new name, or remove the old file yourself first.
- `applicationId` (optional) - the application whose infobase is dumped, from `get_applications`. Default: the project's default application. For an extension project, the application belongs to the base configuration project.
- `extensionName` (optional) - export this extension of the configuration instead of the configuration itself. Give the extension's name as the infobase knows it (the extension configuration's `Name`); the EDT project name of an extension project of this configuration is accepted too. With an extension project in `projectName` it must be omitted or name that same extension.
- `allowOutOfDate` (optional, default `false`) - see "Infobase vs project" below.
- `waitSeconds` (optional, default 20, 0 to 45) - how long this call waits before returning a `jobId`. The dump itself keeps running in the background either way.

## Infobase vs project
Before dumping, the tool prepares the application (starts its standalone server if needed and connects the project, as EDT's own export command does) and reads EDT's own comparison of the ONE project the file corresponds to with what was last applied to the infobase: the configuration project for a `.cf`, the extension project for a `.cfe`.
- `inSync` - EDT reports that project equal.
- `outOfDate` - EDT reports a difference: the call is REFUSED and nothing is written. Apply the project with `update_database` first, or pass `allowOutOfDate=true` to dump what the infobase holds now.
- `unknown` - EDT could not tell (no project holds that extension, the comparison did not settle within 30 s, or the state could not be read). The dump is made and the result says so explicitly.

The state is reported as `infobaseSync` in the result. It is NOT the update state `get_applications` shows: that one is up to date only when the configuration AND every extension project of it are equal. So a `.cf` dump can be `inSync` while `get_applications` asks for an update because an extension lags (a `.cf` holds no extensions), and a `.cfe` dump can be `inSync` while the configuration lags.

## What you get
Markdown with front matter: `status`, `source` (`configuration` / `extension`), `project`, `extensionName`, `applicationId`, `application`, `infobase`, `outputFile`, `sizeBytes`, `infobaseSync`.

Success is reported only after the file was seen on disk: the Designer writes to a temporary `<name>.partial-<id>.cf(e)` beside `outputFile`; the tool checks it is non-empty and written by this call, renames it to `outputFile` (never replacing a file that appeared meanwhile), and reads the size back. `outputFile` is created only by that rename, so a failed, cancelled or timed-out call never creates it; a failure also removes the temporary file. The one exception: when the size read back after the rename does not match, or cannot be read, the file is left in place (nothing proves it is still this call's) and the error says so - inspect or delete `outputFile` before retrying.

## Background job
The dump can take minutes on a large configuration. When it does not finish within `waitSeconds`, the call returns a `jobId`: poll `get_job_status` with it, and do not start the same export again. The phases are bounded: waiting for another operation on the same infobase (5 min), preparing the application (5 min), reading the synchronization state (1 min), the dump itself (30 min).

The 30-minute bound abandons a dump that has not finished. `cancel_job` stops the export only while it still waits for the infobase: once preparing the application starts, the work is handed to EDT and `cancel_job` says so instead of cancelling. EDT kills a Designer process it started, but does NOT stop a dump running in its Designer-agent session. The tool removes the temporary file when it abandons the dump, so a Designer that finishes later can still leave `<name>.partial-<id>.cf(e)` beside `outputFile` (the job's progress names it): delete it.

## Errors
- **No platform with a thick client** - EDT found no locally installed 1C:Enterprise version matching the project and infobase. Install it (with the thick client) and register it in EDT's installed platforms.
- **Login failed** - store the infobase user with `set_infobase_credentials`; it needs the right to administer the configuration.
- **Unknown extension** - the Designer's own message is returned; check the extension is installed in this infobase under that name.
- **Busy infobase** - another `update_database` / `launch` / export holds the same infobase; wait and retry.
- **Port conflict** - the standalone server could not start because its ports are taken; free them and retry.

## Notes & gotchas
- The tool writes only `outputFile` (and its temporary sibling). It changes neither the project nor the infobase, but preparing the application may start its standalone server.
- A remote-only platform installation cannot run the Designer locally; install the platform on the EDT machine.

## Maintainer note
After adding/changing this tool, the `tools/list` golden snapshot (`tools_list.golden.json`) MUST be regenerated against the live server on the EDT stand - it cannot be hand-edited.
