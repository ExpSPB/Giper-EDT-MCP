Lists the line breakpoints and workspace-wide BSL exception breakpoints currently registered in EDT. Use it to verify conditions and hit-count rules, inspect break-on-error state, and recover breakpoint ids.

## When to use
- To check which breakpoints are active before a debug run.
- To find the `breakpointId` of a breakpoint you want to remove.
- To confirm a `set_breakpoint` actually registered.

## Parameter details
- `projectName` - optional filter for line breakpoints; omit to list them across all projects. Exception breakpoints are workspace-wide and are returned whatever this filter names.

A breakpoint with no marker is NOT listed - the listing is built from markers - and the platform can recognise one by interface alone, which `set_error_breakpoint` reports as an entry it configured but cannot name by id. Read that call's own `configuredCount` and warning for it; EDT's Breakpoints view shows it too.

## What you get
JSON: `breakpoints` and a `count`. A line entry has `kind: "line"`, coordinates, enabled state, and its debug model; non-empty `condition` and positive `hitCount` / `hitCondition` fields appear only when configured. An exception entry has `kind: "exception"`, `workspaceWide: true`, `enabled`, `catchAllExceptions`, and `exceptionMessage` only when a filter is set - a catch-all entry OMITS that field rather than sending it empty. An entry whose marker could be reached but not READ carries an `error` field instead of the fields that read would have produced: check for it before relying on the rest of that entry, since a missing `enabled` there means "not readable", not "false". A breakpoint whose marker cannot be reached at all is skipped instead - it has no id to be listed under.

## Notes & gotchas
- The `modelId` tells you the breakpoint's debug model. It does NOT tell you whether the breakpoint can suspend: the marker-only fallback `set_breakpoint` creates when the EDT BSL breakpoint class is missing reports the same BSL model id as a native one. The call that CREATED the breakpoint is what says so - `set_breakpoint` answers `degraded: true` with a warning in that case.
- Remove entries with `remove_breakpoint` (pass the `breakpointId`).
- Use `set_error_breakpoint(enabled=false)` to disable the workspace-wide exception breakpoint while preserving its filter. To delete any breakpoint permanently, including a workspace-wide exception breakpoint, pass its `breakpointId` to `remove_breakpoint`.
